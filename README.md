This project was envisioned to allow a user to search for different crypto's and have it display back to them their current price. It allows a user to input an amount of crypto as if they own it, to see what they could sell it all for. It will then allow a user to save whichever crypto they want to a Database and they can then view which crypto they saved when and what USD amount they could have sold it for. 
Our stretch goals included converting the USD price to other currencies so users from around the world could utilize our website. 

This website uses a Crypto Exchange API to pull coin data when the user searches for a given coin symbol. 

### Problem Domain
Our problem domain was displaying up to 5 cryptocurriencies and display the amount each is worth in USD.
